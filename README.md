# Smart_Diabetes_Diagnostics_with_ML
<p>This repository contains the code and dataset for building and comparing various machine learning algorithms to predict and diagnose diabetes. The project aims to analyze health-related attributes and determine the most accurate algorithm for diabetes detection.</p>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant</li>
  <li>Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration</li>
  <li>BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)</li>
  <li>SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)</li>
  <li>Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)</li>
  <li>BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)</li>
  <li>DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function</li>
  <li>Age: Age in years</li>
  <li>Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1), indicating the presence of diabetes (1) or absence (0)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Algorithms Explored</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Decision Tree:</b> A non-linear predictive model that recursively splits data based on features to make decisions.</li>
  <li><b>SVM (Support Vector Machine):</b> A powerful classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate data points into different classes.</li>
  <li><b>ANN (Artificial Neural Network):</b> A computational model inspired by the human brain, capable of learning complex patterns and relationships in data.</li>
  <li><b>Ensemble:</b> A technique that combines multiple individual models (e.g., Decision Trees) to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setup and Usage</h2>
<p>To run this project, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clone this repository to your local machine.</li>
  <li>Install Python 7.0.1 and the necesarry packages including matplotlib.</li>
  <li>Run the Cloud.py file to perform data preprocessing, model training, evaluation and results.</li>
  <li>When the GUI appears, click on upload files and give the csv dataset.</li>
  <li>Click on the following buttons to preprocess data, get accuracy of algorithms and a comparison graph.</li>
  <li>View the results and accuracy scores of each algorithm to determine the most accurate model.</li>
</ul>
